The CREATE DATABASE statement is a foundational SQL command used to create new databases in SQL-based Database Management Systems (DBMS), including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and others. Understanding how to use this command effectively is crucial for developers, database administrators, and anyone working with relational databases.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

To know which database I am currently using;
```sql
SELECT DATABASE();
```

To delete a database
```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```
