SQL is a query language that communicates with relational databases.

A database is an organized collection of structured data, usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).
Databases help us easily store, access, and manipulate data held on a computer.

DBMS uses a technique called normalization to minimize redundancy by splitting large tables into smaller, 
more efficient ones. Compared to traditional file systems, DBMS offers greater flexibility 
and more advanced backup mechanisms. DBMS systems are categorized based on data models, distribution, 
or user numbers. Common types include relational, distributed, hierarchical, object-oriented, and network DBMS. 
A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships 
within the database.
