# DROP TABLE in SQL
The DROP TABLE statement in SQL is used to delete a table and all of its data from the database permanently.
This operation cannot be undone, and once the table is dropped all data in that table is lost.
Once executed, this operation removes the table definition and all of its rows, so the table can no longer be accessed or used.
This action is irreversible which means that once a table is dropped, it cannot be recovered unless there is a backup.
Syntax:

The syntax to use the DROP TABLE command in SQL is:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
